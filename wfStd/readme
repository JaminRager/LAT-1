1)
use makecut to create 2D histograms for each detector and subset as given in data.txt
the histogram has trapENFCal (x-axis) and wfstd (y-axis) in 0.1 keV binning wfstd is calculated based on the waveforms

2)
use makecut3 to run over all the 2histograms in the root files
- it fits the calibration files and uses the fitfunction in the background to set cut. 
- it set the threshold after the spectrum came down after the noise wall (if there is one left)
- use this to calcualte exposure curves (for each subset!)
- if fit wasnt good, remove subset from exposure

3)
in the output directory, use makeplot to make the plots, efficiencyof the cut is calculated based on the events 
  in the calibration that are removed above the threshold set in 2)
  if efficiency < 60% ignore this data and increase threshold (assume cut wasnt good)
  sum up over datasets and modules
